KMeans Clustering Implementation
===================================

--------------------------------------------
* This repository was created mostly as a learning experience but it is an implementation nonetheless. The data I used to create clusters around was sales data.

* A clustering algorithm would not really work well with data of this sort, a regression approach would've been more suitable and would have produced more meaningful results. 

* The code was adapted from [`this`](https://github.com/tugrulhkarabulut/K-Means-Clustering/blob/master/k_means.py) repository, along with a few minor changes to make it viable for the type of data I was working with; which I am unfortunately unable to make available for replication.
